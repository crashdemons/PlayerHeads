# PlayerHeads
Bukkit Plugin - Drops a player's head when s/he dies, also mob heads
* Drop player heads on player death
* Drop mob heads on death
* Configure drop rate chances
* Configure whether player-kills are required to drop

All credit goes to meiskam for creating the plugin and zand, Dragoboss, any many others for maintaining it.

# Craftbukkit support
This is the implementation branch for Craftbukkit 1.13 support.  While this branch is mostly reliant on bukkit-standard features, it also presumes the server has the "authlib" API available to it (for head texturing and improved UUID retrieval), which makes it insufficient for other implementations like Glowstone.
