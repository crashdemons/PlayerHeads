/**
 * An interface specifying all of the methods we need for our plugin that require differing Bukkit-specific implementations which we wish to abstract from our plugin code.
 * CompatibilityProviders not only must implement this interface, but in order to be automatically selected by the Compatibility class,
 * they must exist in a specific package name.
 * 
 * Providers (or a class extending them) are expected to exist in the same package as the compatibility library (com.github.crashdemons.playerheads.compatibility by default).
 * followed by the server type name and major/minor version.  For example: com.github.crashdemons.playerheads.compatibility.craftbukkit_1_16
 * the class in this package must be named "Provider" and must not be abstract.
 * 
 * Secondly, to be automatically selected by the Compatibility class, the server type and version must be listed in the CompatibilitySupport class' VERSIONS map.
 * This is typically accomplished by replacing it in the compatibility-library module when shading in all relevant support classes (ie: the original is excluded from shading).
