Same simple plugin, new improvements.


# Where's the Source!?
The main project combines different code from multiple modules - you need to look into those module directories for the code.

For the code behind core plugin behavior see the **PlayerHeads-core** module.

For an API to use the plugin from your own plugins there is also a lighter-weight API available from the **PlayerHeads-api** module.

Otherwise, you can check out the **-support** modules for any server-specific implementation code
