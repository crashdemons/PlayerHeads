===========

Experimental support for 1.13.1 by shimming item creation and type-checking methods. Tested on spigot 1.13 / 1.13.1.

This branch attempts to maintain the original code function in 1.13+.

See the `master` branch for one that attempts to improve upon it with more reliable head skinning support.
